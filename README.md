A spoof login page like Facebook’s to know the passwords of your family and friends :)
It can also be hosted on LAN or on the web
It uses jQuery to get the credentials from the client-side's login page and stores them in a text file which is present on the same system where server is running.
Also, it is made using NodeJs' express.
